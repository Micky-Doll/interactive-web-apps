<!-- 
Why does the code not work?

     The script file was not correctly linked in the HTML document
     Spelling errors in HTML and JS files
     Script tag not closed
     scripts.js runs before index.html thus the 'footer' element does not yet exist


 What changes do you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?

     Spelling error in <scripts src=""> tag
     </scripts> missing
     <title></title> missing
     Spelling error 'form' to 'from' in scripts.js 
     I placed 'company' and 'year' in {} as they are being sourced from the same file
     Used 'defer' to load JS and HTML simultaneously; JS file only executes after the HTML is done rendering
     Added HTML boilerplate text for preference

Are there any other ways in which it can be solved?

     You could place the <script> tag at the bottom of the <body> in the HTML file to force the latter to fully render before the JavaScript is loaded
     You could use the 'DOMContentLoaded' event which tells your <script> to execute only once your HTML has been parsed
